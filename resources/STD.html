<h4>4.x.y.6	Test procedure. </h4>
<p>This paragraph shall define the test procedure for the test case. The test procedure shall be defined as a series of individually numbered steps listed sequentially in the order in which the steps are to be performed. For convenience in document maintenance, the test procedures may be included as an appendix and referenced in this paragraph. The appropriate level of detail in each test procedure depends on the type of software being tested. For some software, each keystroke may be a separate test procedure step; for most software, each step may include a logically related series of keystrokes or other actions. The appropriate level of detail is the level at which it is useful to specify expected results and compare them to actual results. The following shall be provided for each test procedure, as applicable:
<ol type="a">
<li>Test operator actions and equipment operation required for each step, including commands, as applicable, to:
<ol>
<li>Initiate the test case and apply test inputs</li>
<li>Inspect test conditions</li>
<li>Perform interim evaluations of test results</li>
<li>Record data</li>
<li>Halt or interrupt the test case</li>
<li>Request data dumps or other aids, if needed</li>
<li>Modify the database/data files</li>
<li>Repeat the test case if unsuccessful</li>
<li>Apply alternate modes as required by the test case</li>
<li>Terminate the test case</li>
</ol>
</li><br/>
<li>Expected result and evaluation criteria for each step</li><br/>
<li>If the test case addresses multiple requirements, identification of which test procedure step(s) address which requirements. (Alternatively, this information may be provided in 5.)</li><br/>
<li>Actions to follow in the event of a program stop or indicated error, such as:
<ol>
<li>Recording of critical data from indicators for reference purposes</li>
<li>Halting or pausing time sensitive test support software and test apparatus</li>
<li>Collection of system and operator records of test results</li>
</ol>
</li><br/>
<li>Procedures to be used to reduce and analyze test results to accomplish the following, as applicable:
<ol>
<li>Detect whether an output has been produced</li>
<li>Identify media and location of data produced by the test case</li>
<li>Evaluate output as a basis for continuation of test sequence</li>
<li>Evaluate test output against required output </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>4.x.y.7	Assumptions and constraints.</h4>
<p>This paragraph shall identify any assumptions made and constraints or limitations imposed in the description of the test case due to system or test conditions, such as limitations on timing, interfaces, equipment, personnel, and database/data files. If waivers or exceptions to specified limits and parameters are approved, they shall be identified and this paragraph shall address their effects and impacts upon the test case.</p>

<h1>5.	Requirements traceability. </h1>
<p>This paragraph shall contain:
<ol type="a">
<li>Traceability from each test case in this STD to the system or CSCI requirements it addresses. If a test case addresses multiple requirements, traceability from each set of test procedure steps to the requirement(s) addressed. (Alternatively, this traceability may be provided in 4.x.y.1.)</li>
<li>Traceability from each system or CSCI requirement covered by this STD to the test case(s) that address it. For CSCI testing, traceability from each CSCI requirement in the CSCI's Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and associated Interface Requirements Specifications (IRSs). For system testing, traceability from each system requirement in the system's System/Subsystem Specification (SSS) and associated IRSs. If a test case addresses multiple requirements, the traceability shall indicate the particular test procedure steps that address each requirement.</li>
