</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>3.2		Impact of test environment.</h2>
<p>This paragraph shall provide an assessment of the manner in which the test environment may be different from the operational environment and the effect of this difference on the test results.</p>

<h2>3.3		Recommended improvements.</h2>
<p>This paragraph shall provide any recommended improvements in the design, operation, or testing of the software tested. A discussion of each recommendation and its impact on the software may be provided. If no recommended improvements are provided, this paragraph shall state "None."</p>

<h1>4.	Detailed test results.</h1>
<p>This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to describe the detailed results for each test. Note: The word "test" means a related collection of test cases.</p>

<h2>4.x		(Project-unique identifier of a test).</h2>
<p>This paragraph shall identify a test by project-unique identifier and shall be divided into the following subparagraphs to describe the test results.</p>

<h3>4.x.1		Summary of test results. </h3>
<p>This paragraph shall summarize the results of the test. The summary shall include, possibly in a table, the completion status of each test case associated with the test (for example, "all results as expected," "problems encountered," "deviations required"). When the completion status is not "as expected," this paragraph shall reference the following paragraphs for details.</p>

<h3>4.x.2		Problems encountered. </h3>
<p>This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs that identify each test case in which one or more problems occurred.</p>

<h4>4.x.2.y	(Project-unique identifier of a test case).</h4>
<p>This paragraph shall identify by project-unique identifier a test case in which one or more problems occurred, and shall provide:
<ol type="a">
<li>A brief description of the problem(s) that occurred</li><br/>
<li>Identification of the test procedure step(s) in which they occurred</li><br/>
<li>Reference(s) to the associated problem/change report(s) and backup data, as applicable</li><br/>
<li>The number of times the procedure or step was repeated in attempting to correct the problem(s) and the outcome of each attempt </li><br/>
<li>Back up points or test steps where tests were resumed for retesting</li><br/>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>4.x.3		Deviations from test cases/procedures.</h3>
<p>This paragraph shall be divided into subparagraphs that identify each test case in which deviations from test case/test procedures occurred.</p>

<h4>4.x.3.y	(Project-unique identifier of a test case). </h4>
<p>This paragraph shall identify by project-unique identifier a test case in which one or more deviations occurred, and shall provide:
<ol type="a">
<li>A description of the deviation(s) (for example, test case run in which the deviation occurred and nature of the deviation, such as substitution of required equipment, procedural steps not followed, schedule deviations). (Red-lined test procedures may be used to show the deviations)</li><br/>
<li>The rationale for the deviation(s)</li><br/>
<li>An assessment of the deviations' impact on the validity of the test case</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>5.	Test log.</h1>
<p>This section shall present, possibly in a figure or appendix, a chronological record of the test events covered by this report. This test log shall include: 
<ol type="a">
<li>The date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the tests performed</li><br/>
<li>The hardware and software configurations used for each test including, as applicable, part/model/serial number, manufacturer, revision level, and calibration date of all hardware, and version number and name for the software components used</li><br/>
