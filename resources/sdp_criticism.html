		<h1>Phase 1 SDP Criticism</h1>
		<pre>
SDP: 43.75/50

-  4.1: We are following RUP, eh?

-  4.2.4: Explain how you will handle the requirements. I.e. the plan for the requirements, not a design for what you are going to do.

-  5.6.2, 5.6.3: This isn't a plan. It is the design activity itself. This is just a plan.

-  5.7.3: Too specific for a plan. DO you really want to re-do the whole SDP is you choose to not, for example, use python?

-  5.14: You need some kind of CM. Are you using Git? Github?

-  5.17.1 huh?

-  6.2: Spiral Dev? That isn't mentioned anywhere in section 3/4 (particularly 4.1?)
